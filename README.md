## This is work in progress!

Right now, I have an AM2302 hooked into a protoboard, I wrote code to drive it but then hated the way it couples to the ST peripherics library.

I am using a Discovery board, with an an ST32F100RB Cortex-M 3 ARM Microprocessor.

I will (slowly) complete an interrupt-driven driver for the AM2302 single-wire comunication protocol.
